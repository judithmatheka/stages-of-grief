    <p>Grief is the state of extreme sadness caused to human being mostly by loss of a loved one or intense suffering to someone they have affection for Kübler-Ross & Kessler (2009). Depending on the nature of the loss or suffering, people may experience varied levels of pain hence grieve for some time before coming to terms. Grief is usually an intricate phenomenon which may expose someone to various phases as they heal. In most cases, anger is the first thing that hits someone when the loss occurs. Other experiences could entail extreme confusion and astonishment.</p>
    <p>From previous studies, grief has occurred to people in five main stages which range from denial at the onset of the loss as anger creeps in. Bargaining is also one of the stages of grief, accompanied by depression in some people before one embraces acceptance. It will be noted that not everyone undergoes all the stages of grief outlined above. One’s ability to endure the loss determines the grief cycle and the duration will be taken to overcome. </p>
<p>The stages of grief could be outlined as follows:</p>
<p>Denial: Upon the loss occurrence, denial could be a factor the will help the possible victim come to terms with the loss and as such be able reduce the adverse effects of grief. At this stage, someone take time to reflect on the moments they spent with the departed person as reality of the loss sets in</p>
<p>After a while the bereaved persons will try to accept that the sad even is well beyond their control and what will be extreme sadness (Friedman & James, 2008). During the gloom moment, the person tries to exude the anger in various ways as the bad emotions fade with time. In a bid to alleviate the bad feeling, someone may be tempted to engage in unusual things. This is usually not viewed as obscene in that moment as people react differently in order of eradicate the anguish being experienced. Grieving persons sometimes enter in bargaining covenants with supernatural powers due to despair, hoping that bigger help will through.</p>
<p>When the help does not seem to come in as fast, some people feel desperate and hence fall into depression, whose effects are usually unbearable. The emptiness felt due to the loss is sometimes beyond recoupment. This mostly happens to those who are weak and cannot comprehend the suffering. Despite all the above stages of grief, some people develop some resistance mechanisms that help them overcome the sad moments. By such acceptance normalcy comes back and people are able moon with less pain.</p>
